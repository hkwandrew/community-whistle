# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## GitHub Pages

- Vite `base` is set from `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`, so the built site works from a repo subpath like `/community-whistle/`.
- Public image paths are relative (no leading `/`) so assets resolve correctly on GitHub Pages.
- The contact form runs in demo mode on static builds; set `VITE_CONTACT_ENABLED=true` and point it at a real backend when you are ready.
- Deploy by enabling Pages for GitHub Actions and letting `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` run on pushes to `main` or via a manual dispatch.
